Django 3 + PostgreSQL 10+ Migration Issue
=========================================

This repository contains example code demonstrating migration issue in Django 3 with PostgreSQL 10+

To reproduce the issue you need to have bash and docker-compose installed. I have tested the script on Linux machine.

Start databases with docker-compose:

``docker-compose up -d``

and run test.sh:

``./test.sh``
